## Introduction

### 1. The Global Terrorism Database
**The Global Terrorism Database ([GTD](https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/))** is an open-source database including information on terrorist attacks around the world from 1970 through 2017. The GTD includes systematic data on domestic as well as international terrorist incidents that have occurred during this time period and now includes more than 180,000 attacks. The database is maintained by researchers at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), headquartered at the University of Maryland.

- **Clean the data**
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis** on the dataset
- **Analyze the data** more deeply and extract insights
- **Visualize analysis** on **Google Data Studio** . Please find our Google Data Studio report [here](https://datastudio.google.com/open/1qgH08qHKrJUIfveZQLTSEiWpAQcMCC5G).
